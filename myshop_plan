1) EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
This document is a step-by-step, modular plan to enhance the MyShop backend into a scalable, maintainable, and production-ready system. It bundles technical tasks, operational tasks, testing, monitoring, and where and how to use AI tools to accelerate development without sacrificing quality. Use this as your master plan and check items off as you complete them.

2) HOW TO USE THIS DOCUMENT
- Work phase-by-phase. Each phase contains tasks, deliverables, acceptance criteria, and suggested AI tools to help.
- The "Daily / Week-by-week" section gives a suggested cadence. You're free to go slower; the plan is modular.
- Keep a running journal in the repository (CHANGELOG.md) to capture decisions and reasons for easier rollback.

3) PHASE-BY-PHASE DETAILED PLAN

PHASE 0 — DISCOVERY & SAFETY CHECK (Deliverables: Inventory, Staging, Backups, KPIs)
Tasks:
- Inventory: list apps, dependencies, infra, secrets. Create a spreadsheet of endpoints, DB size, and top-slow queries.
- Create staging environment similar to production.
- Full DB and media backup and restore test.
- Define KPIs: request latency targets, error budget, expected daily requests, peak concurrent sessions.
AI HELP:
- Use AI (ChatGPT / Claude / Copilot) to auto-generate an inventory checklist by scanning README, Dockerfiles, and settings files (prompt the model with repo snippets).
- Use GitHub Copilot or Tabnine while writing scripts to dump DB and automate backup tests.
Acceptance:
- Staging runs the current app and accepts fake transactions. Backup + restore verified.

PHASE 1 — CODE HYGIENE & REPO STRUCTURE (Deliverables: modular apps, linting, settings)
Tasks:
- Reorganize Django apps (products, orders, users, payments, reviews, notifications, search).
- Add pre-commit hooks (black, isort, flake8), CI lint step.
- Move secrets to env and create settings/base, dev, prod pattern.
AI HELP:
- Use Copilot / ChatGPT to create consistent settings stubs and example .env templates.

PHASE 13 — DEPLOYMENT & SCALING
Tasks:
- Choose between managed services or K8s; add pgbouncer and read replicas if needed.
AI HELP:
- Use AI to suggest deployment templates (Helm charts) and scaling rules based on metrics; it can help convert human intent into manifest templates ready for minor edits.
Acceptance:
- Able to scale web and worker tiers independently.

4) RECOMMENDED AI TOOLS (DETAILED & WHERE TO USE THEM)
Below is a categorized list of AI tools and exactly where to use them in the project. Use these tools as accelerators, not as blind autopilot — always review generated code.

A) Code generation, autocompletion & scaffolding
- GitHub Copilot / Copilot for Teams
  * Use while writing serializers, viewsets, migration helpers, and tests.
  * Use for generating boilerplate Dockerfiles, GitHub Actions workflows, and k8s manifests.
- Tabnine / Codeium / Amazon CodeWhisperer
  * Helpful for offline IDE completions and multi-language projects.
- How to use:
  * Prompt: include short context + example of model or function and ask for a serializer or test.

B) Large language models for architecture, designs & explanations
- ChatGPT (OpenAI), Claude (Anthropic), Gemini (Google)
  * Use these for brainstorming architecture alternatives, writing runbooks, generating SQL index suggestions (feed the slow query), and drafting documentation.
- How to use:
  * Paste non-sensitive code or abstract descriptions and ask for options, risks, and alternative approaches.

C) Automated code review & security scanning
- Snyk, Dependabot, GitHub CodeQL, DeepSource
  * Use for dependency vulnerability scanning, static analysis, and automated fixes or PRs.
- How to use:
  * Integrate in CI to run on every PR. Review suggested fixes manually.

D) Test generation & load testing assistance
- ChatGPT / Copilot for unit test templates.
- K6 Cloud / Locust for load scripts. Use AI to craft realistic user behavior scenarios (browsing, search, checkout).
- How to use:
  * Provide endpoint list and metrics; ask AI to generate realistic Locust scenarios with proper pacing and randomized inputs.

E) Observability & incident response helpers
- AI can draft Prometheus alert rules and Grafana dashboard templates.
- Use ChatGPT to generate incident playbooks and RCA templates from logs & traces.
- How to use:
  * Feed sanitized traces or error messages to AI for structured RCA drafts.

F) Data, search, & recommendations
- Use Python ML helpers (OpenAI embeddings, Hugging Face inference API, or Elasticsearch learning-to-rank).
- Use AI to prototype product similarity using embeddings (product description embedding, cosine similarity).
- How to use:
  * Produce embeddings offline (batch), store them, compute nearest neighbors for recommendations; use AI to write prototype scripts and to tune vector similarity thresholds.

G) Content & marketing automation
- Use AI copywriting (ChatGPT, Jasper) for product descriptions, SEO titles, and email templates (promotions, cart reminder).
- How to use:
  * Batch-produce descriptions, then human-edit for correctness. Store original product attributes and generated suggestions in admin UI for quick approve/publish workflow.

H) Testing & QA automation
- Use AI to create test cases and to convert bug reports into reproducible steps.
- Tools: Testim, Functionize (commercial) or AI-assisted test generation using local models.
- How to use:
  * Convert issue description into step-by-step test scripts or Playwright tests via AI prompts.

I) Cost & infra optimization
- Use AI to audit infra costs and generate suggestions (right-size instances, use spot instances) — many cloud consoles also provide cost recommendations; AI can help turn them into action items.
- How to use:
  * Provide billing summaries (non-sensitive) to AI for suggestions; then confirm in cloud console.

Notes on data privacy and secrets:
- Do not paste secrets, private keys, or raw payment webhook payloads containing secrets into public LLM prompts.
- Use non-sensitive examples or sanitized logs when interacting with external AI models.
